# General Terms and Conditions of Use

# ZenyPass Service

## ARTICLE 1 - PRESENTATION OF THE ZENYPASS SERVICE

ZENYWAY SAS has developed and operates a service that is available and that
runs from the web, under the name "ZenyPass" (the "ZenyPass Service")
to store, modify, delete and synchronize on ZenyPass servers, data and
information provided by each user
(the "User").

The ZenyPass Service is accessible and usable from any device
running a compliant operating system and internet browser
([see the list of compatible devices](/password-manager/faq/en/index.html#access-2)),

and is only allowed via applications
provided by ZENYWAY, and published under an open source license
(https://opensource.org/licenses), including the ZenyPass Web application
(the "ZenyPass Applications").

The data and information provided by the User and stored via
the ZenyPass Service (including passwords, phone pin codes, etc.)
(the "Records") are beforehand encrypted by one of the ZenyPass Applications
so that their decrypted content is accessible only to the User.

The ZenyPass Service is free for up to five (5) Records.
Beyond five (5) Records, the storage of each Record
is charged to the User (see details below).

## ARTICLE 2 - PURPOSE

These general terms and conditions of use (the "General Terms and Conditions
of Use ") are intended to govern the terms and conditions of use of the
ZenyPass Service by any User, as well as to define the rights and
obligations of any User.

The ZenyPass Service is provided by ZENYWAY, a French company
with a capital of 10,000 euros, having its registered office located 65 rue de
Paris, 92190 MEUDON, France, registered in
Nanterre, France under the number 814 890 463 ("ZENYWAY").

## ARTICLE 3 - ACCEPTANCE OF THE GENERAL CONDITIONS OF USE

The creation of a User Account (as defined below), also called Vault, as well as the
use of the ZenyPass Service requires full acceptance
of these General Terms and Conditions
of Use, which constitute the contract
between ZENYWAY and the User.

By using the ZenyPass Service, the User declares having read
these General Terms and Conditions of Use, including rules
relating to the protection of personal data and to the security of
Records set out in section 5 hereof, having understood their scope,
and accepting them by checking the box "I have read and I accept the conditions
of use of ZenyPass". By checking the box, the User
declares to accept all the provisions of these General Terms and Conditions
of Use, which are opposable to him from that moment.

ZENYWAY reserves the right to modify, at any time and without notice, all
or part of these General Terms and Conditions
of Use, in particular in order to adapt them to changes in
legislation and / or changes in the ZenyPass Service.
The modification will take effect immediately upon the uploading of
the updated General Terms and Conditions of Use. The User will be invited to
read and accept them according to the process described above.

In any case, any use of the ZenyPass service by the User implies unreserved
acceptance of the General Terms and Conditions of Use in force, including after a
modification of the General Terms and Conditions of Use.

If one or more provisions of these General Terms and Conditions of Use
are declared invalid, unwritten or ineffective, the other
provisions shall not be invalid in any way and shall continue to produce
their full effects.

In the event of failure to comply with any of the obligations provided for in
these General Terms and Conditions of Use, ZENYWAY reserves the right to delete
the User Account of the User concerned.

The User declares to be of legal age, to have the legal capacity to
use the ZenyPass Service in accordance with these General Terms and Conditions of Use
and applicable regulations.

## ARTICLE 4 - ACCESS AND USE OF THE ZENYPASS SERVICE

### 4.1 Creation of a User Vault

Any use of the ZenyPass Service necessarily requires
the User to create a user vault, or user account
(The "User Vault" or "Vault" or "User Account") through one of the ZenyPass Applications.

To do this, the User must provide a valid email
address, and choose a unique password
(The "ZenyPass Password"). The ZenyPass Password is one of the keys
used to encrypt the different User Records.

The User Vault is strictly personal. Any access to the User Vault
using the ZenyPass e-mail address and password will
be deemed to have been made by the User.

The User agrees to keep the ZenyPass Password secret and not to disclose it
for any reason. In the event of loss or forgetfulness of the ZenyPass Password
or any fraudulent use that it suspects or of which it is aware, the User must
immediately inform ZENYWAY by sending an e-mail to the following address:
contact@zenyway.com. It is specified that ZENYWAY has no access to the
ZenyPass Password chosen by the User and the latter is not transmitted
over the Internet, in order to avoid any interception by a third party or
piracy from an external server, and thus to guarantee the confidentiality
of the User's data. Therefore, if ZenyPass Password is lost or forgotten,
it can not be reset by ZENYWAY. The User will therefore have to reset his
User Account, making the request by sending an email to the address
contact@zenyway.com and create a new ZenyPass Password, which will result in the
loss of the access to all the Records, but will retain the amount of available
Records for that User Account. The User will thus have to re-register
the data and information he wishes to store via the ZenyPass Service
(as described below).

The User is solely responsible for the use, preservation and
confidentiality of his ZenyPass e-mail address and password, and
releases ZENYWAY from any liability resulting from the provision of a
wrong e-mail address or the disclosure of the
ZenyPass password to anyone.

### 4.2 How the ZenyPass Service Works

The ZenyPass Service provides the User with a simple and centralized reading
of all his Records.

The ZenyPass Service allows an easy connection to some websites accessible
via passwords. To do this, the User must first connect to his Vault
and add websites to which he wishes to be connected via the
ZenyPass Service (the "Registered Web Sites").

The addition of Registered Web Sites can be done by the User
from his Vault, by filling
a form (including the URL address of the website's login page
that he wishes to register and the corresponding password).

The User may then access the Registered Web Sites from his Vault,
by clicking the thumbnail of the Registered Website
to which he wishes to connect.

For security and privacy reasons, ZenyPass Applications
may ask the User to identify himself / herself when adding
Records, or to connect him / her to a Registered Web Site
requiring login credentials.

ZENYWAY is in no way responsible for the information obtained by
The User from the Registered Web Sites.

Similarly, ZENYWAY is not responsible for any malfunction,
failure, inability to access the ZenyPass Service and / or Registered Websites
attributable to the User's Internet provider, the
Registered Web Sites, or any other event beyond the control of ZENYWAY.

## ARTICLE 5 - PROTECTION AND CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONAL DATA

### 5.1 Protection of personal data

ZENYWAY attaches particular importance to confidentiality issues and
therefore takes great care to ensure the protection and confidentiality
of any personal data communicated by Users.

As such, the collection and processing of the personal data communicated, through a checkbox,
by the Users via the ZenyPass Service during the creation of their User Account, to
subscribe to the ZenyPass newsletter
(namely an email address) were the subject of
a declaration of compliance with a simplified standard with the
French National Commission for Data Processing and Liberties
(CNIL) under number 1910777.

In accordance with the law "Informatique et Libert√©s" of January 6th, 1978,
as amended, the User has the right to access and rectify his personal
information, which he can exercise at any time by sending his request by email,
accompanied by a copy of his valid identity document and indicating his e-mail
address, to contact@zenyway.com.

The User may also, for legitimate reasons, object to the processing
of his personal data.

Furthermore, ZENYWAY attaches the utmost importance to the User's prior
consent to the use, if any, of his personal data for the purposes of
prospecting by ZENYWAY's trading partners, through a checkbox. In any case,
the User may object to the use of his data for the purposes of prospecting
by ZENYWAY by sending an e-mail to the following address: contact@zenyway.com.

Finally, the User can also, at any time, delete his User Account
by making the request by sending an email to the address
contact@zenyway.com.

ZENYWAY undertakes to ensure that any User personal data, even those
transmitted to potential business partners, if any, are not
transmitted outside the European Union, except with the express prior consent
of the User.

ZENYWAY reserves the right to transmit any User personal data,
either to comply with a legal obligation, or in application of a judicial,
administrative, or independent administrative authority (such as the
French National Commission for Data Processing and Liberties) decision.

### 5.2 Record Security

The ZenyPass Service includes an automated data processing system.
Any fraudulent access to the latter or any alteration of said system is
prohibited and liable to criminal prosecution.

ZENYWAY commits to the use of adequate safety systems and procedures
to ensure the protection and security of the records stored in the
User Vault, in particular by means of the
encryption processed by ZenyPass Applications. The Records are
readable (in deciphered version) only by the User, ZENYWAY having
access to the encrypted version of said records.

Nevertheless, in view of the complexity of the Internet environment,
ZENYWAY can not be held to an obligation of result relating to
the security of the Records. Consequently, breaches of the confidentiality
of the Records shall not incur the liability of ZENYWAY, for any reason
whatsoever and for any damage whatsoever.

In particular, ZENYWAY can not be held liable in the event that a
third party accesses its User Vault and its Records, or if the
said Records would be disclosed for a reason attributable to the
Registered Web Sites.

The User agrees to take all precautions to protect his Records
and not to commit any act that could jeopardize the security
of the system and his Vault.

In general, it is strongly recommended that the User ensure
that the ZenyPass Password he chose to access his Vault
is sufficiently complex to avoid any interception or piracy by a third party.

Any new device on which the User wishes to use the ZenyPass Service must first
be authenticated by the User, by a procedure which requires validation via a
device already authenticated. However, the User is advised not to use the
ZenyPass Service on a mobile phone or a computer of which he is not the owner
or whose use is shared with a third party, in order to avoid any fraudulent
connection to his Vault. In this case, ZENYWAY can under no
circumstances be held responsible for any damage caused to the User.

Upon becoming aware of this, the User agrees to promptly inform ZENYWAY
(at the following address: contact@zenyway.com) of any failure of
his User Account or any doubt as to possible fraudulent access to his
Vault.

additional Records for 9, 94 euros).
The User can also purchase for 69 euros the Premium version
